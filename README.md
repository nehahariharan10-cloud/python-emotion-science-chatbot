# python-emotion-science-chatbot
A rule-based Python chatbot that explains the neuroscience behind common emotions.

## Background

I am a high school student beginning my journey in software development. This project was built independently from scratch without tutorials to strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals and program structure.

## Overview

This project is a console-based chatbot designed to connect emotional awareness with basic brain science. The program identifies keywords associated with four emotional states (happy, sad, angry, and scared) and responds with short, neuroscience-informed explanations of what may be happening in the brain.

The goal of this project was to build a structured, interactive application using core Python concepts while creating something educational and meaningful.

## How It Works

1. The user enters a feeling or emotional description.
2. The program splits the input into individual words.
3. Each word is checked against predefined keyword lists for four emotion categories:
   - Happy
   - Sad
   - Angry
   - Scared
4. If a match is found, the chatbot returns a randomized science-based explanation related to that emotion.
5. If no match is found, a neutral fallback response is returned.
6. The conversation continues until the user types `"bye"`.

The chatbot uses rule-based classification rather than machine learning, making the logic transparent and easy to follow.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Lists and nested data structures
- Functions and return values
- Conditional logic
- While loops
- String manipulation
- Randomized response selection
- Basic rule-based natural language processing

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Built-in `random` module
- Console input/output

## Example Interaction

```
Hello, I'm Feely!
How are you feeling today?   anxious

(•_•;)   Anxiety is driven by heightened activity in fear and prediction circuits in the brain...
```

## Future Improvements

- Support multiple emotions in one response
- Build a GUI or web interface
- Store conversation history
- Expand emotion categories

## Purpose

This project was created as part of building a software development portfolio. It demonstrates the ability to design a structured, interactive Python application with clear logic and user flow.
